
Many of my colleagues have lots of Java experience but not much C++ experience.
This project aims to make Kinect development a little more user-friendly by
wrapping the Microsoft SDK in Java and removing all things VisualStudio.

Basically:
Kinect is fun.
Java is fun.
C++ isn't fun.

The code's not perfect, by any means - this was a first foray into JNI.
However, we've found it useful, maybe you will also.

Please feel free to contribute advice, code etc.

INSTALLATION
------------
I'm guessing this, but I think you should just need to ...
- install the Microsoft Kinect SDK.
- download this wrapper (it's an IntelliJ project).
- run the "main" file for an example.

Please let us know if this isn't the case.
